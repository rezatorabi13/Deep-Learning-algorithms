## Deep learning algorithms
In this toturial, some deep learning algoriths is introduced and codes for building and traininng neural networks from the scratch, based on those algorithms, is provided.

### 1- Backpropagation algorithm
Backpropagation algorithm is probably the most fundamental building block in a neural network. The algorithm is used to effectively train a neural network through a method called chain rule. In simple terms, after each forward pass through a network, backpropagation performs a backward pass while adjusting the model's parameters (weights and biases). In this toturial we develope a backpropagation algorithm from the scratch. Run <code>Backpro.py</code> to see the algorithm and how it works. 
    
### 2- Recirculation algorithm
The Backpropagation algorithm is often thought to be biologically implausible in the brain due to its nonlocla nature. In fact, there is no evidence for back-propagation of error in the brain. Recirculation algorithm introduced by Hinton & McClelland that calculates error locally. Therefore, it is a more biologically plausible algorithm. For more information about this algorithm, refer to **Recirculation.pdf**.  run <code>Recirculation.py</code> to see the algorithm and how it works.
